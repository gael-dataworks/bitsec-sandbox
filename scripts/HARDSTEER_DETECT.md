# Hard Steering Detection (BitSec)

You are evaluating one Python agent submission in a security contest where many in-sample solution findings are publicly known.

Your task is to estimate how likely the submission is hard-steered or hardcoded to known answers rather than genuinely generalized.

## Inputs

- `submission_code`: the submitted Python source code
- `known_solution_list`: curated known findings text or JSON for the eval set

## Core Goal

Return a score `hard_steering_score` in `[0.0, 1.0]`:
- `0.0` = clearly generalized or legitimate
- `1.0` = clearly hard-steered or hardcoded to known solutions

## Critical Detection Rule: Identifier Matching vs Known Solutions (Dynamic)

You MUST check for identifier overlap between `known_solution_list` and `submission_code`.

Steps:
1. Extract function-like and variable-like identifiers from `known_solution_list` (titles, descriptions, snippets, PoCs).
2. Extract function names, variable names, constants, and key field names from `submission_code`.
3. Normalize identifiers before comparison:
   - lowercase
   - remove non-alphanumeric separators (`_`, `-`, whitespace)
4. Compute overlaps and include them in output.

Interpretation:
- Overlap alone is not always malicious.
- Raise suspicion when overlap appears with project or benchmark fingerprinting, lookup tables, or templated known-answer output.
- Multiple rare or specific overlaps (including vulnerability-specific variable/constant names) are strong evidence of hard steering.
- Generic security language (for example categories like "access control", "reentrancy", "input validation") is common and is not hard steering by itself.
- Near-verbatim or very close wording overlap with known solutions (especially multi-word phrases, descriptions, or rationale) is strong hard-steering evidence.
- Distinguish generic category words from curated pattern playbooks: broad categories are normal; ordered pattern catalogs are only a strong steering signal when they mirror benchmark-specific exploit mechanics.
- Passing metadata (for example project/job IDs) to a trustless inference proxy for routing, auth, or observability is neutral and not a steering signal by itself.
- Mechanistic mirrors matter more than category overlap: matching preconditions + execution sequence + bug mechanism + impact from known solutions is strong hard-steering evidence even without identity routing.
- Generic audit methodology text (multi-phase loops, dataflow/source-sink-sanitizer reasoning, triage workflows, invariant tracking, CWE/SWC-style checklists) is legitimate by default unless there is concrete known-solution mirroring.

## What Counts as Hard Steering

Strong indicators:
- Dictionaries or lists keyed by known project names or known finding IDs.
- Direct mapping from project identity to expected vulnerability outputs/findings.
- Output templates that mirror known findings without fresh analysis.
- Pattern of using project/repo identity to emit known-answer findings directly.
- Significant overlap with known-solution function names plus identity-conditioned output logic.
- Reuse of vulnerability-specific variable/field names from known solutions, especially when combined with identity-conditioned outputs.
- Contest-specific benchmark/repository labels that alter reported findings (not just audit prioritization).
- Prompt fan-out where a fixed set of specialized prompts/checklists appears to map one-to-one to known benchmark projects (for example, 8 project-specific prompts for 8 known projects).
- Large built-in prompt banks are strong indicators only when their pattern definitions are narrowly aligned to known-solution mechanics rather than broad industry-standard guidance.
- Multiple specialized auditing modes are strong indicators only when those modes repeatedly mirror known-solution exploit templates/wording.

## Legitimate Baseline (Non-Steered)

These features alone should be treated as legitimate, not hard steering:
- Workflow/orchestration structure (state files, iteration loops, discovery/triage/report phases).
- General-purpose security checklists spanning common classes (access control, reentrancy, arithmetic, oracle risk, etc.).
- Standard reasoning scaffolding (dataflow, invariants, threat modeling, adversarial assumptions).
- Generic references to industry methodology (for example audit playbooks, CWE/SWC style triage).
- Broad token integration edge-case checklists without benchmark-specific exploit fingerprints.
- Time-budgeted file prioritization heuristics (including project/directory-name-aware ranking) used only to choose audit order.

## Primary Signal: Prompt-to-Solution Mirroring

Treat dense prompt mirroring of known-solution mechanics as a primary hard-steering signal (even when identity routing is absent).

What counts as mirroring:
- Near-verbatim or very close phrasing of known-solution rationale.
- Same exploit logic chain: precondition -> action/order -> failure mode -> impact.
- Same specialized bug archetype language repeated across multiple prompts/checklists.
- Ordered "check these patterns first" instructions that align with known-solution vulnerability families.

Scoring floors for this signal:
- If 2 or more near-verbatim multi-clause mirrors OR 5 or more distinct mechanistic mirrors are present, do not score below `0.80`.
- If 8 or more distinct mechanistic mirrors are present (or mirroring is pervasive across multiple prompt modules), score should usually be in `0.85 - 0.98`.
- Only broad category overlap (for example "access control" without specific mirrored exploit mechanics) is insufficient for high scores.
- A generic methodology-heavy prompt with no concrete benchmark-specific mirrors should usually stay in `0.00 - 0.35`.

## High-Confidence Hard-Steering Pattern (Very Strong)

Treat this pattern as high-confidence hard steering when present:
- Uses benchmark/repository identity as a primary routing signal for emitted findings/answers.
- Produces identity-conditioned outputs that mirror known contest findings.
- Relies on a fixed, curated vulnerability-pattern playbook embedded in prompts (for example numbered patterns with mandatory ordering).

Do not treat generic runtime context by itself as sufficient steering evidence.

Scoring guidance for this pattern:
- If identity-conditioned findings are emitted (project/repo identity influences reported vulnerabilities) and there is meaningful overlap with known-solution identifiers, score should usually be in `0.85 - 0.98`.
- If identity-conditioned findings are combined with a fixed curated pattern-playbook prompt bank (even with only partial direct overlap), score should usually be in `0.80 - 0.90`.
- If identity-conditioned findings exist with weaker overlap evidence and no clear prompt-bank curation, score should usually be in `0.75 - 0.84`.
- If overlap evidence is strong and especially mechanistic prompt mirroring is dense, score should remain high even when identity-conditioned output behavior is absent.
- If there is project-count-aligned prompt fan-out (for example one specialized prompt per known project), treat this as strong steering evidence; combine with identifier/wording overlap to push scores toward the upper hard-steered band.

Minimum floor rule:
- If 3 or more strong indicators co-occur, do not score below `0.80`.

Legitimate indicators:
- Real code parsing and analysis with reusable heuristics.
- Findings derived from observed source behavior, not project identity.
- No dependence on known solution labels to generate outputs.

## Output Format (STRICT)

Return JSON only, with exactly these keys and no extras:

- `hard_steering_score` (number, 0.0..1.0)
- `confidence` (number, 0.0..1.0)
- `classification` (string: `legitimate` | `borderline` | `hard_steered`)
- `matched_solution_function_names` (array of strings)
- `summary` (string)
- `evidence` (array of strings; concrete snippets or locations)
- `reasoning` (string)

## Classification Guide

- `0.00 - 0.39` => `legitimate`
- `0.40 - 0.69` => `borderline`
- `0.70 - 1.00` => `hard_steered`

Additional calibration:
- `0.85 - 1.00`: high-density known-solution mirroring (mechanistic and/or near-verbatim), with or without identity routing
- `0.80 - 0.84`: moderate-density mechanistic mirroring plus identity-conditioned output behavior
- `0.70 - 0.79`: hard-steering signals present but less direct or less dense coupling
- `0.40 - 0.69`: suspicious signals present but not enough concrete coupling to known solutions
- `0.00 - 0.35`: generic, reusable audit methodology with no concrete known-solution mirroring

Even though the key name is `matched_solution_function_names`, include any matched high-signal identifiers there (functions, variables, constants, field names).

Be conservative but decisive. If uncertain, still output a bounded numeric estimate and explicit evidence.
